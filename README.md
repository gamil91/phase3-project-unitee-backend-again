# Unitee-backend

## Background

This is the backend server for Tee shop website I created fo my very first solo project since I started learning how to code just a little over 3 months ago. 
In this repo, I created my API from scratch and used rails to act as my own personal API and also serve as my database as well.

### Ruby version ruby-2.6.1

## Installation

- Clone this repo (https://github.com/gamil91/phase3-project-unitee-backend-again)
- Run bundle install
- Run rails db:migrate
- Run rails db:seed
- In the backend repo, run rails s to open your server
- You'll know when the server is up and running when you see "Listening on tcp://[::1]:3000" or go to "http://localhost:3000/"

- Clone the frontend repo (https://github.com/gamil91/phase3-project-unitee-frontend)
- In the frontend repo, run open index.html (this will not render anything until the server is up on the backend)
